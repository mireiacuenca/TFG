## Water and electricity pattern consumption analysis during the Covid-19 pandemic in Barcelona 

### Abstract

Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on our society, changing the way people interact and their habits. Focusing on the city of Barcelona, during 2020, citizens were confined several months, and this had affected to their lifestyles. This project aims to analyse how the water and electricity consumption in Barcelona reflect these changes in the daily life of people. 
For our analysis, we extracted information from Aig√ºes de Barcelona and Open Data from the Ajuntament de Barcelona. This data provided us of knowledge of aggregated water and electricity consumption, temperature by month and year, population by district zone and census section, average rent, and Gini index by district zone. With all this information, we processed, cleaned, analysed, and modelled the data, with the goal of extracting highlights about the differences in the consumption during 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The project is structured in three parts: Processing and Cleaning the data, Data Exploratory and Analysis, and Modelling. For the development of each part, there are some useful tools that we have used, these include Python libraries as seaborn, sklearn and shap.
Finally, the research provides a complete view of the effect that Covid-19 had in the consumption. We found that the during and after the pandemic had different behaviour in consumption within industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors. Also, found discrepancies between population and territories within the city.

### Structure of the project
The structure of the project is divided into three parts: processing and cleaning data, data exploratory and analysis, and modelling.

| Part | Description |
| :---         |     :---:      |
| Part 1: Processing and cleaning data   | Cleaning datasets and processing their data.    |
| Part 2: Data exploratory and analysis     | Analysis of each dataset features.      |
| Part 3: Modelling     | Creating models to predict values.      |

Each part is formed of five blocks depending on the data. Each block has their datasets and from each we want to extract some information and results.
##### - Block 1: Commercial, industrial and domestic datasets
##### - Block 2: Water consumption by activity dataset
##### - Block 3: Census section datasets
##### - Block 4: Postal code datasets
##### - Block 5: District zone datasets
