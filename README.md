# TFG: Water and electricity pattern consumption analysis during the Covid-19 pandemic in Barcelona


1. [Descripción del proyecto]

Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on our society, changing the way people interact and their habits. Focusing on the city of Barcelona, during 2020, citizens were confined several months, and this had affected to their lifestyles. This project aims to analyse how the water and electricity consumption in Barcelona reflect these changes in the daily life of people. 
For our analysis, we extracted information from Aigües de Barcelona and Open Data from the Ajuntament de Barcelona. This data provided us of knowledge of aggregated water and electricity consumption, temperature by month and year, population by district zone and census section, average rent, and Gini index by district zone. With all this information, we processed, cleaned, analysed, and modelled the data, with the goal of extracting highlights about the differences in the consumption during 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The project is structured in three parts: Processing and Cleaning the data, Data Exploratory and Analysis, and Modelling. For the development of each part, there are some useful tools that we have used, these include Python libraries as seaborn, sklearn and shap.
Finally, the research provides a complete view of the effect that Covid-19 had in the consumption. We found that the during and after the pandemic had different behaviour in consumption within industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors. Also, found discrepancies between population and territories within the city.
